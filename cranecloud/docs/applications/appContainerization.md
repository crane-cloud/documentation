A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all it's dependencies so that an application is reliable and runs fast regardless of the computing environment. A container image is a standalone lightweight executable package that includes everything it needs to run an application.

**Container images become containers at runtime.**

If you have your application already containerized jump to the next section. If you have no need help containerizing you could use this resource <https://docs.docker.com/develop> or you can reach out and the team could avail you access to an autocontainerization tool.

Crane Cloud currently offers an automated containerization services called "MIRA" within the platform, to support application deployment. We discuss how to use MIRA for application deployment later in the application deployment options section.
