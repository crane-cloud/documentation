5. Select **A Record** for Type and enter the **Host** you would like to point to an IP address: (You will be issued IP addresses by the crane cloud admin).
@ - this is used to point a root domain (e.g yourdomain.co.uk)  to the IP address:

   **A Record | @ | 11.22.xx.xx**

   **www** - is selected when it is needed to point www.yourdomain.co.uk to the IP address:

   **A Record | www | 11.22.xx.xx**

   **[any host]** - you can insert any name of a subdomain that should be pointed to the IP address:
  
   **A Record | blog | 11.22.xx.xx**

   "*" - a wildcard record that matches requests for non-existent subdomains:
   **A Record | * | 11.22.xx.xx**

6. Once all the details are inserted, save them using the **Save Changes** green icon.(Typically, it takes about 30 minutes for newly created records to take effect)

**NB:** Make sure there are no conflicting records set for the same host and remove them if there are any. The records you need to check may be Unmasked/Masked/Permanent Redirect, A, or CNAME record types.

#### B:
1. Go to http://www.godaddy.com, sign in and click on Manage on the Domain row.
