By default if no tag is provided for your image, Crane Cloud assumes the tag "latest" just like Dockerhub and is able to still create a web hook link for you. All you have to do is click the "Generate link" button.

But in case you want to explicitly set the image tag, you can type it in the input field provided for example "production"

After inputting the tag you can go ahead and click to generate the relevant webhook URL

To make use of the generated webhook, head over to dockerhub.com and click under the specific repository for the image you deployed on Crane Cloud, and click the "Webhooks" tab. Fill in any name for your webhook and copy and paste the URL that was generated from Crane Cloud.
