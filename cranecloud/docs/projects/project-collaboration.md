# Project Collaboration

With project collaboration you are able to invite other members on the platform or external users by email to join your project on Crane Cloud as either Members or Administrators and each role has its own limitations as far as managing a project is concerned.

## How to access project collaboration

As the owner of an existing or new project, you should be able to access the `project settings` section of that project from the project dashboard.

Under project settings you will find information about your project such as its name, description and status, whether active or disabled.

Furthermore, the project settings is composed of three sections which include:

- Project Details, which presents the meta data about a project
- Membership, which presents the owner and various members on the project with their specific roles
- Manage Project, which presents the project management controls such as updating, disabling and deleting a project.

## Membership section

This section provides information about the following

- The number of members under the project
- The username and email for each member along with their given role under the project

## Inviting a member to a project

In this section we explore how you can invite or add a collaborator to your project and what information or steps you need to follow to ensure that the invitation is successful, and the first step to this is clicking on the `Invite Member` button.

The Invite Member button launches a modal that requires the following information:

- An email for the collaborator/user is required for purposes of notifying them with an email invite
- The collaborator's role which can either be `Member/Administrator` which can determine what they can do under a project

NB: Once the correct details are provided, an invitation for collaboration is dispatched to the specified email. This invitation includes a link through which the collaborator can gain access to the project. 

Be aware that error messages will be displayed for incorrect input or if a user with the provided email already exists under the project.

## Accept/Decline an invitation

When a collaborator receives an invite and they proceed to access the project they have been invited to, they have two options to either `Accept or Decline` the invitation.

- Once they log into their account on the platform, they will see the project they have been invited to and would need to either accept or reject the invitation

- Trying to then access that project as a collaborator on-click will launch a modal that prompts you to either accept or decline the invitation.

Furthermore after accepting the invitation, you should be able to access the applications and databases of that particular project and other limitations are tied to either your collaboration role is either `Member or Administrator`

- NB: A collaborator has the right to leave a project incase they are nolonger interested in collaborating on that given project
